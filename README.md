# LostandFound
Webtech project

To run our code:

cd myfrontend
npm start

cd mybackend
node app.js

We made a Lost and Found website which is
designed to emulate a physical lost and found
online. Users are only required to have an
account before accessing the functionalities we
offer. They can sign up using a unique
username, email id and password. Users can
submit the details(name, description, image,
location, category)of an unclaimed/lost item
and provide their phone number. The reported
items are sorted into categories.

If someone has lost the item, they can make
use of the dynamic search functionality to find
their item. Theyâ€™ll be able to view an image of
the object and the description. If they item is
theirs and they wish to claim it, they can use
either the listed contact number or the email
address to get in touch with the person who
has reported the said item. If the item has
been claimed by another person, the poster
can then remove the submitted item.
